10203437		1	Lupus-like syndrome caused by 5-aminosalicylic acid in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
10225085		1	Although the two local anesthetics usually do not cause methemoglobinemia, we suspect that the displacement of lidocaine from protein binding by bupivacaine, in combination with metabolic acidosis and treatment with other oxidants, was the reason for the development of methemoglobinemia.
10225085		1	Methemoglobinemia after axillary block with bupivacaine and additional injection of lidocaine in the operative field.
10225085		1	We report a patient with chronic renal failure and ischemic heart disease who developed clinically significant methemoglobinemia after an axillary block with bupivacaine and additional injection of lidocaine in the operative field.

10332990		1	We describe a life threatening side effect of acute epoprostenol infusion (pulmonary edema) in a patient with pulmonary hypertension associated with limited scleroderma and discuss its management and potential etiology.
10337682		1	A 14-year-old girl with newly diagnosed SLE developed a pruritic bullous eruption while on prednisone.
10348150		1	Hydroxyurea-induced acute interstitial pneumonitis in a patient with essential thrombocythemia.
10348150		1	The clinical course suggests that the interstitial pneumonitis was induced by hydroxyurea.
10348150		1	This is the first case of hydroxyurea-induced acute interstitial pneumonitis reported in the literature.
10357715		1	Allergic and irritant contact dermatitis to calcipotriol.
10357715		1	Calcipotriol (Daivonex R; Leo Pharmaceuticals, Zurich, Switzerland) may cause irritation of the skin, whereas allergic reactions are less common.
10357715		1	The present observation suggests, that a batch of different testing doses, including lower testing doses may help to differentiate between an allergic type of contact dermatitis and an irritant type of reaction after treatment with calcipotriol.
10367184		1	Myotonia associated with sarcoidosis: marked exacerbation with pravastatin.
10367184		1	Pravastatin is associated with myotonia in animals.
10367184		1	This case suggests that sarcoidosis and pravastatin, two entities not frequently associated with myotonia, may interact in a synergistic manner to produce severe clinical myotonia in humans.
10393393		1	Hypersensitivity to aspirin can be manifested as acute asthma, urticaria and/or angioedema, or a systemic anaphylactoid reaction.
10395123		1	CONCLUSION: Fixed drug eruption is associated with many drugs but this is the first such report with omeprazole.

10431414		1	One case of priapism occurred during heparin therapy for a previous surgical operation to the knee is reported.
10431414		1	Priapism as a complication of heparin therapy.
10431414		1	The association between heparin and priapism is often recognized; abnormal platelet aggregation could play a role in the pathogenesis of this side effect.
10435399		1	It carries a well-known risk of neutropenia and agranulocytosis, which necessitates the immediate discontinuation of clozapine.
10435399		1	OBJECTIVE: We report a patient who developed neutropenia on clozapine, but behind the cell count decrease showed to be a diurnal variation of the white blood cells (WBC).
10439378		1	Acute neutrophilic dermatosis induced by all-trans-retinoic acid treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia.
10442258		1	Findings on discontinuation and rechallenge supported the assumption that the hair loss was a side effect of the paroxetine.
10442258		1	Hair loss associated with paroxetine treatment: a case report.
10442258		1	We report on a 37-year-old female who complained of moderate hair loss during paroxetine treatment.
10452772		1	CONCLUSION: Patients with insulin allergy may not have complete resolution of their symptoms after standard desensitization, particularly those patients with concomitant protamine allergy.
10452772		1	METHODS: The patient required insulin desensitization for severe urticaria, angioedema, and occasional wheezing resulting from her insulin dose.
10452772		1	OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether desensitization to NPH insulin, as well as standard insulin desensitization, could control allergic symptoms in a patient allergic to both NPH and regular insulin.
10452772		1	Patients receiving neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin are at increased risk for the development of protamine hypersensitivity.
10452772		1	Protamine allergy as a complication of insulin hypersensitivity: A case report.
10452772		1	She continued to receive regular insulin 4 times per day over the following 3 years with only occasional hives.
10452772		1	The patient had recurrence of urticaria and angioedema a year and a half later, at which point the NPH was stopped and she was desensitized to regular insulin.
10458196		1	A 5-month-old infant became lethargic and poorly responsive after receiving 1 drop of brimonidine in each eye.

10458196		1	Apparent central nervous system depression in infants after the use of topical brimonidine.
10458196		1	CONCLUSIONS: Topical brimonidine may be associated with central nervous system depression in infants.
10458196		1	PURPOSE: To report two cases in which topical brimonidine resulted in apparent central nervous system depression and unresponsiveness in an infant.
10461415		1	Ceftriaxone was approved in 1997 for the treatment of otitis media despite previous studies that documented an association of ceftriaxone with elevated hepato-biliary enzymes and transient biliary stasis.

10466445		1	During the first days of arsenic trioxide treatment a rapid decrease in the D-dimers was seen (normal values reached until day 7), together with a slight decrease in peripheral blood leukocytes.
10467499		1	A 22-year-old black man developed fever, chills, fatigue, night sweats, tender lymphadenopathy, and a generalized, pruritic, macular eruption 3 weeks after starting minocycline therapy for acne.
10467499		1	With the negative viral serologies, the clinical picture was most consistent with an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome produced by the minocycline ingestion.
10473079		1	We conclude that the presence of this metabolic defect combined with topical 5-FU (a drug demonstrating a narrow therapeutic index) results in the unusual presentation of life-threatening toxicity after treatment with a topical drug.
10473079		1	We now report the first known cancer patient who developed life-threatening complications after treatment with topical 5-FU and was shown subsequently to have profound DPD deficiency.
10475726		1	An acute ischaemic event associated with the use of venlafaxine: a case report and proposed pathophysiological mechanisms.
10475726		1	The association of venlafaxine treatment with ischaemic events could be explained by its unique pharmacological and haemodynamic properties.
10475726		1	This is the first report of a possible association between an acute cardiovascular event and venlafaxine.
10475726		1	We present a case of an elderly woman with a pre-existing history of ischaemic heart disease, who was treated with venlafaxine, and developed acute myocardial ischaemia within the first week of treatment.
10482872		1	Apparent cyclophosphamide (cytoxan) embryopathy: a distinct phenotype?
10482872		1	The purpose of this report is to document a new case of in utero CP exposure with multiple congenital anomalies and to establish an apparent CP embryopathy phenotype.
10482872		1	The reported cases of in utero exposure to cyclosposphamide shared the following manifestations with our patient: growth deficiency, developmental delay, craniosynostosis, blepharophimosis, flat nasal bridge, abnormal ears, and distal limb defects including hypoplastic thumbs and oligodactyly.
10482872		1	We conclude that (a) cyclophosphamide is a human teratogen, (b) a distinct phenotype exists, and (c) the safety of CP in pregnancy is in serious question.
10487084		1	In all cases, seizures were controlled by withdrawal of phenytoin and reduction of drug levels.
10487084		1	Paradoxical seizures in phenytoin toxicity.
10487084		1	We present three patients with paradoxical seizures; their serum phenytoin levels were 43.5 mcg/mL, 46.5 mcg/mL and 38.3 mcg/mL.
10492493		1	CONCLUSIONS: This case suggests that losartan can induce late-onset angioedema in patients with normal renal function and that the reaction can recur after initial resolution of the symptoms.
10492493		1	Losartan-induced angioedema.
10492493		1	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of angioedema associated with losartan administration.
10492493		1	The incidence of angioedema secondary to losartan, an angiotensin II receptor antagonist, is unknown.
10494874		1	We report the case of a female acromegalic patient in whom multiple hepatic adenomas appeared soon after danazol treatment for uterine fibromatosis.

10510017		1	There remains a paucity of information pertaining to alternative anticoagulation strategies for use during cardiopulmonary bypass concomitant with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, especially in children.
10510017		1	We report the successful treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and subsequent hemorrhagic complications postoperatively in a 2-year-old child with Danaparoid (orgaran).
10513720		1	Taxane-induced glaucoma.
10513720		1	We report a case of glaucoma induced by doxetaxel therapy for metastatic breast cancer.

10524732		1	Prolongation of the QT interval and ventricular tachyarrhymias have been described in patients on amiodarone therapy.
10524732		1	We report a case of recurrent torsades de pointes following treatment with pentavalent antimonial drugs and amiodarone.
10530201		1	Emphasis is given to the differentiation of diphenylhydantoin induced gingival hyperplasia from the angiomatous enlargement of the gingiva before any treatment is planned.
10555917		1	A 66-year-old Japanese woman with severe scleroderma developed anemia and thrombocytopenia due to D-penicillamine (D-Pen) treatment, although the leukopenia was not markedly severe.
10555917		1	Cessation of D-Pen and the start of corticosteroid therapy were followed by recovery from bicytopenia.
10555917		1	In vitro inhibition of hematopoiesis in a patient with systemic sclerosis treated with D-penicillamine.
10555917		1	These findings suggest that bicytopenia in this patient was caused by D-Pen and may be due to different sensitivities in the hematopoietic lineage.
10560960		1	A 48-year-old woman who was treated for thyrotoxicosis with methimazole developed agranulocytosis.
10566542		1	Postoperative hypocalcemic tetany caused by fleet phospho-soda preparation in a patient taking alendronate sodium: report of a case.
10566542		1	This case report describes a patient who was previously prescribed alendronate (Fosamax) and presented with postoperative hypophosphatemia and hypocalcemic tetany after bowel preparation with Fleet Phospho-Soda.
10575189		1	Described here are 2 patients who developed thrombotic microangiopathy of the kidneys after receiving high cumulative doses of the new anticancer drug gemcitabine.
10575189		1	Thrombotic microangiopathy with renal failure in two patients undergoing gemcitabine chemotherapy.
10579985		1	The first patient was a 61-year-old man with a 30-year history of fistulizing CD in whom B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed 9 months after treatment with infliximab.
10579985		1	The relationship between infliximab treatment and lymphoma in Crohn's disease.
10579985		1	The second is a 29-year-old man with CD in whom nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphoma was diagnosed 3 weeks after infusion with infliximab.
10579985		1	We describe the clinical course of 2 patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in whom lymphoma was diagnosed after treatment with infliximab.
10586009		1	Codeine intoxication in the neonate.
10586009		1	We report a case of codeine intoxication in the neonate, in which the drug was prescribed for cough control during an emergency department visit.
10589077		1	Hydroxyurea (HU) and sodium phenylbutyrate (SPB) have been shown to increase fetal hemoglobin (Hb F) levels in patients with thalassemia intermedia.
10589077		1	Of the four patients who responded to HU with an increase in total Hb, all reported symptomatic improvement and three have not required further transfusions.
10589077		1	Prolonged responses were achieved with low doses of HU (3-10 mg/kg/day) and higher doses were associated with mild reversible hematologic or hepatic toxicity and no further increases in Hb.
10589077		1	Sodium phenylbutyrate was added to treatment with HU in two patients, but failed to produce an increase in total Hb despite increasing Hb F levels.
10589077		1	We conclude that low-dose HU therapy in patients with thalassemia intermedia may increase total Hb levels sufficiently to eliminate the need for transfusions.
10589077		1	We describe the clinical response, as determined by increases in total Hb and decreased transfusion needs, in five patients with thalassemia intermedia treated with HU alone or in combination with SPB.
10592946		1	A 36-y-o patient with schizophrenia, who had consumed gradually increasing quantities of oolong tea that eventually reached 15 L each day, became delirious and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital.
10592946		1	After abstinence from oolong tea his delirium resolved.
10592946		1	Severe rhabdomyolysis following massive ingestion of oolong tea: caffeine intoxication with coexisting hyponatremia.
10592946		1	The clinical course suggests that caffeine, which is present in oolong tea, was mainly responsible for the rhabdomyolysis as well as the delirium, although severe hyponatremia has been reported to cause rhabdomyolysis on rare occasions.
10592946		1	The possibility of severe rhabdomyolysis should be considered in a patient with water intoxication due to massive ingestion of caffeine-containing beverages.
10592946		1	We hypothesize that caffeine toxicity injured the muscle cells, which were fragile due to the potassium depletion induced by the coexisting hyponatremia, to result in unusually severe rhabdomyolysis.
10599932		1	After the addition of citalopram, a desmethylclomipramine plasma level increase and an 8-hydroacy-desmethylclomipramine plasma level decrease were observed.
10607332		1	We report 3 cases of HIV-1 infected patients who experienced symptomatic angiolipomas shortly after starting antiretroviral therapy including the protease inhibitor indinavir.
10610018		1	Elevated serum triglycerides with clozapine resolved with risperidone in four patients.
10610018		1	In two patients clozapine was reinstated after risperidone was discontinued; serum triglyceride levels increased.
10610018		1	This increase when clozapine was switched to risperidone and vice versa is consistent with our previous report of elevated serum triglyceride levels in clozapine-treated patients.
10614572		1	Intravenous valproate associated with significant hypotension in the treatment of status epilepticus.
10614572		1	To our knowledge, this is the first report of significant hypotension associated with intravenous valproate in the treatment of status epilepticus in the pediatric population.
10614572		1	We report a case of severe hypotension associated with intravenous valproate used to treat status epilepticus in an 11-year-old girl.
10619721		1	In both patients the rippling phenomena worsened with pyridostigmine treatment but markedly improved after immunosuppression with azathioprine.
10633877		1	A diagnosis of masked theophylline poisoning should be considered in similar situations involving a rapid decrease of insulin requirements.
10633877		1	Salicylate intoxication was excluded, and theophylline was finally incriminated.
10633877		1	Theophylline intoxication mimicking diabetic ketoacidosis in a child.
10633877		1	This compound, used by adults in the child's home, had caused accidental theophylline poisoning, mimicking diabetic ketoacidosis.
10646879		1	Methylene blue in the treatment and prevention of ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy: report of 12 cases and a review of the literature.
10646879		1	Ten to 15% of patients treated with ifosfamide develop an encephalopathy.
10646879		1	We conclude that MB is an effective treatment for ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy.
10650865		1	Portal vein thrombosis in a patient with severe haemophilia A and F V G1691A mutation during continuous infusion of F VIII after intramural jejunal bleeding--successful thrombolysis under heparin therapy.
10650865		1	We report on a 14-year-old boy with severe haemophilia A who developed a portal vein thrombosis during continuous infusion of F VIII.
10656221		1	A 60-year-old woman with diabetes mellitus (type 2) developed an acute icteric hepatitis-like illness 6 weeks after the initiation of gliclazide therapy.
10656221		1	Gliclazide-induced acute hepatitis.
10656221		1	In conclusion, this case strongly suggests that gliclazide can induce acute icteric liver necro-inflammation which may be misdiagnosed clinically as acute viral hepatitis.
10656221		1	We believe that this is the first description of acute hepatitis caused by an idiosyncratic adverse reaction to gliclazide or to one of its metabolites.
10656221		1	We describe the case of acute hepatitis induced by gliclazide, a second generation sulfonylurea.
10667036		1	Caution is, therefore, needed to prevent undesired accumulation of TCA that may lead to protracted Cushing's syndrome.
10667036		1	Cushing's syndrome persisted more than 6 months while TCA concentrations remained detectable for at least 80 days.
10667036		1	The presented patient was treated with 200 mg TCA and developed Cushing's syndrome 6 weeks later (cortisol and ACTH concentrations were below limits of detection, TCA concentrations were > 3 micrograms/l).
10679548		1	Both had impaired lung function and abnormal computed tomographic scans, and their condition improved when nitrofurantoin was withdrawn and corticosteroid treatment commenced.
10679548		1	Bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia associated with the use of nitrofurantoin.
10679548		1	The case histories are presented of two patients who developed lung disease associated with the use of nitrofurantoin with histological features of bronchiolitis obliterans organising pneumonia (BOOP), a rare but recognised form of drug induced injury.
10679548		1	The favourable outcome in these two patients contrasts with the fatal outcome of the two other reported cases of nitrofurantoin induced BOOP.
10679548		1	The spectrum of nitrofurantoin lung injury continues to widen.
10679548		1	The two middle aged women presented with respiratory symptoms after prolonged treatment with nitrofurantoin.
10679548		1	"We suggest that the previous classification of nitrofurantoin induced lung injury into ""acute"" and ""chronic"" injury is an oversimplification in view of the wide variety of pathological entities that have subsequently emerged."
10682234		1	Intravenous administration of levodopa ameliorated a refractory akathisia case induced by interferon-alpha.
10682234		1	The present report illustrates a rare case of refractory akathisia after interferon-alpha treatment and also that levodopa treatment would be theoretically and practically useful in reducing the neurotoxicity associated with interferon-alpha.
1068531		1	Acute erythroid leukemia after cyclophosphamide therapy for multiple myeloma: report of two cases.
1068531		1	The development of erythroid leukemia plus carcinoma in these two men suggests mutagenic change secondary to cyclophosphamide therapy.
10688731		1	Scleroderma-like reaction induced by uracil-tegafur (UFT), a second-generation anticancer agent.
10688731		1	This is the first report of UFT-induced scleroderma-like reaction.
10688731		1	We report a case of a scleroderma-like reaction induced by long-term administration of UFT.
10698143		1	Central nervous system manifestations of an ibuprofen overdose reversed by naloxone.
10698143		1	Ibuprofen overdose is usually characterized by GI upset, dizziness, and mild sedation.
10698143		1	Presently, treatment of acute ibuprofen intoxication with complications requires supportive therapy until the symptoms resolve over 24 to 48 hours.
10698143		1	We report the case of an 11-month-old female infant with a depressed level of consciousness after ingestion of ibuprofen whose mental status markedly improved with administration of naloxone.
10707759		1	Flecainide-associated pneumonitis with acute respiratory failure in a patient with the LEOPARD syndrome.
10707759		1	Flecainide is a rare cause of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and few cases have been reported.
10707759		1	We describe a case of interstitial hypoxaemiant pneumonitis probably related to flecainide in a patient with the LEOPARD syndrome, a rare congenital disorder.
10717401		1	Sagittal sinus thrombosis associated with transient free protein S deficiency after L-asparaginase treatment: case report and review of the literature.
10717401		1	We report the case of an adult patient with acute lymphoblastic leukemia who presented with repeated transient ischemic attacks followed by a seizure during consolidation treatment with L-asparaginase.
10723699		1	We report on a young adolescent with benign intracranial hypertension which we attribute to the use of minocycline for acne.

11247558		1	Symptoms and endoscopic lesions quickly regressed within 1 week of meloxicam withdrawal.
11247558		1	We describe a patient who presented with bloody diarrhoea after 15 mg meloxicam daily for 10 days for osteoarthritis.
11247558		1	We suggest that meloxicam might have intestinal toxic effects when taken in high doses, because of reduced COX-2 selectivity.
11250985		1	As these cases revealed, close monitoring of blood chemistry is mandatory after starting spironolactone, and patients should be advised to stop spironolactone immediately if diarrhoea develops.
11250985		1	In patients with chronic heart failure, spironolactone added to conventional treatment may lead to serious and, occasionally, fatal hyperkalaemia.
11250985		1	In some cases this seems to happen because spironolactone causes diarrhoea.

12503933		1	CASE SUMMARY: A 58-year-old white woman developed fulminant liver failure while being treated with the macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin for pneumonia.
12503933		1	CONCLUSIONS: Clarithromycin may be a cause of fulminant liver failure either alone or by inhibiting the metabolism of other drugs.
12503933		1	Fulminant liver failure associated with clarithromycin.
12503933		1	OBJECTIVE: To report a patient developing fulminant liver failure while being treated with clarithromycin for pneumonia.

15338554		1	CONTEXT: Previous investigators have reported discrepancies between hematologic, marrow morphologic, and cytogenetic responses to imatinib mesylate among patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).
15338554		1	Despite a hematologic response in all 3 patients, none of them achieved cytogenetic remission, and all progressed to blast crisis at 7 to 10 months of imatinib therapy.
15338554		1	In addition to disease refractoriness, rare instances of disease progression from chronic phase to blast crisis during imatinib therapy have recently been anecdotally reported.
15338554		1	OBJECTIVES: To describe the clinicopathologic features of 3 patients with CML who rapidly progressed from chronic phase to blast crisis while taking imatinib and to perform a review of the literature.
15338554		1	Our findings suggest that significant progression of marrow reticulin fibrosis during imatinib therapy can be an indicator for a return or progression of CML and, in some patients with CML, imatinib may promote cytogenetic clonal evolution, resulting in a poor response to treatment.
15338554		1	Progression of chronic myeloid leukemia to blast crisis during treatment with imatinib mesylate.

15482394		1	An objective causality assessment indicated a probable relationship between clotting abnormality and warfarin administration, although the degree of elevation of the INR was unusual in the light of the daily warfarin dose and duration of its exposure.
15482394		1	Based on the clinical status of the patient, it was suspected that several conditions contributed to the abnormal hypersensitivity to warfarin.
15482394		1	Despite the low dosage of warfarin, international normalized ratio (INR) was markedly elevated from 1.15 to 11.28 for only 4 days, and bleeding symptoms concurrently developed.
15482394		1	In view of our experience in the present case, it should be stressed that close monitoring of coagulation capacity is necessary in critically ill patients in order to avoid fatal haemorrhage after initiating warfarin therapy regardless of the dosage.

15595320		1	Epstein-Barr virus-associated lymphoproliferative disorder in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis on methotrexate and rofecoxib: idiosyncratic reaction or pharmacogenetics?
15595320		1	Methotrexate (MTX) is a commonly used second line agent for RA, and there have been several recent reports of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated polyclonal B cell lymphoproliferative disorder in MTX-treated RA patients.
15595320		1	Previous studies have demonstrated the interaction of MTX and a variety of non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with various clinical manifestations including acute renal failure, pancytopenia, vomiting, diarrhea, elevated liver transaminases, jaundice, mucosal ulcerations, and pyrexia.
15595320		1	We hypothesize that decreased renal elimination of MTX induced by the COX-2 inhibitor resulted in enhanced hematopoietic toxicity and immunosuppression causing the EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease.

19260037		1	A retrospective review of TTP patients with quinine-associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) for whom ADAMTS13 was measured before plasma exchange was performed.
19260037		1	"Thrombocytopenia with or without microangiopathy following quinine is often referred to as quinine ""hypersensitivity."" When schistocytes are present it is frequently termed ""quinine-associated TTP/HUS."" A severe deficiency of the vWF-cleaving protease, ADAMTS13, is associated with idiopathic TTP."
19260037		1	We conclude that while thrombocytopenia and schistocytosis can be seen in quinine-associated TTP/HUS, the pathophysiology seems to be distinct from that seen in most cases of idiopathic TTP (i.e., severely decreased ADAMTS13 with an inhibitor).

3680913		1	It was restarted 6 weeks later, and 10 weeks after that, the patient presented with fulminant hepatic failure, which resolved rapidly after cessation of nicotinic acid therapy.
3680913		1	Nicotinic acid-induced fulminant hepatic failure.
3680913		1	We suggest that nicotinic acid was the cause of his liver disease, that this case is of particular note because of the rather short period of therapy before the onset of liver injury and the severity of the hepatic failure, and that the probable increased use of nicotinic acid for serum cholesterol control makes it especially important for physicians and their patients to be alert to the signs of hepatotoxicity.

3997294		1	Pneumonitis with pleural and pericardial effusion and neuropathy during amiodarone therapy.
3997294		1	Review of this and previously reported cases indicates the need for early diagnosis of amiodarone pneumonitis, immediate withdrawal of amiodarone, and prompt but continued steroid therapy to ensure full recovery.
4004433		1	Heparin-induced hyperkalemia.
4004433		1	Our findings suggest that hyperkalemia can develop with the use of low-dose heparin, within seven days of initiating heparin therapy, and that patients with diabetes mellitus or chronic renal insufficiency are especially predisposed to this complication.
4004433		1	We present four cases in which the use of heparin was associated with hyperkalemia and discuss the pathophysiology.
4004433		1	While most physicians are aware of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and skin necrosis, the association of heparin and hyperkalemia is less well recognized.

4095247		1	Cerebral and ocular toxicity induced by desferrioxamine.
4095247		1	Subsequent in vivo/vitro studies clearly demonstrated that the neurological effects were due to a synergistic action of desferrioxamine and prochlorperazine, probably resulting in exceptional fluxes of intra/extra cellular iron/copper disturbing noradrenergic and serotonergic systems.
4095247		1	Two of these patients, who also received the anti-emetic prochlorperazine, lost consciousness for 48-72 h and then fully recovered.

8523340		1	How low can you go? Use of very low dosage of gold in patients with mucocutaneous reactions.
85289		1	Anterior spinal artery syndrome--a complication of cervical intrathecal phenol injection.
85289		1	We have seen a case of terminal malignant melanoma in which clinical manifestations, indicative of anterior spinal artery syndrome, developed following the injection of 0.3 ml of 10% phenol-glycerine into the cervical subarachnoid space at the C4--C5 level for the control of severe right arm pain.
8530331		1	One patient required nursing home placement and a feeding gastrostomy as a result of the worsening parkinsonism during risperidone treatment, but was able to return home and have the gastrostomy removed after switching from risperidone to clozapine.
8530331		1	Two of the five patients who worsened motorically also developed encephalopathy during risperidone treatment; the encephalopathy resolved when the patients were switched to clozapine treatment.
8551001		1	Azathioprine can cause severe myelosuppression.
8551001		1	Azathioprine-induced myelosuppression due to thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency in a patient with autoimmune hepatitis.

8551001		1	Thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency occurs at a frequency of one in 300 and is associated with profound myelosuppression after a short course of azathioprine.
8551001		1	We describe the first documented case of azathioprine-induced severe myelosuppression due to thiopurine methyltransferase deficiency in autoimmune liver disease.
8570441		1	Nabumetone-associated interstitial nephritis.
8570441		1	She had been taking nabumetone for 6 months, but had discontinued the agent 2 weeks before admission due to progressive edema.
8579054		1	Acute myeloid leukemia evolving from essential thrombocythemia in two patients treated with hydroxyurea.
8579054		1	In this report, two cases of ET which evolved into AL without prior exposure to radiation or alkylating agents, and which were treated with long-term hydroxyurea therapy, are described.
8579054		1	Prolonged used of hydroxyurea in patients with ET may lead to therapy-associated acute leukemia.
8586895		1	However, in 1993, a clinical study involving 400 patients on the Thai-Burmese border revealed cardiac effects of antimalarial treatment with halofantrine, including one sudden death after the treatment.
8586895		1	In the present paper, we discuss the first Japanese vivax malaria patient whose QT interval was prolonged after treatment with halofantrine.
8586895		1	Prolongation of the QT interval observed in a Japanese patient with vivax malaria following treatment with halofantrine.
8586895		1	The pharmaceutical company producing Halfan has reported 8 cardiac arrests, leading to 6 deaths, when a higher dose than recommended was used, there was recent or concomitant treatment with mefloquine, there was pre-existing prolongation of the QT interval or the patient had a thiamine deficiency.
8589490		1	Supravenous hyperpigmentation in association with CHOP chemotherapy of a CD30 (Ki-1)-positive anaplastic large-cell lymphoma.
8589490		1	We report an unusual pattern of supravenous hyperpigmentation occurring after CHOP chemotherapy.
8597009		1	Phenytoin toxicity due to concomitant antituberculosis therapy.
8597009		1	Seventy-four per cent of patients with epileptogenic disorders seen at the Emergency Unit at Groote Schuur Hospital were on phenytoin and 11.6% of these had blood levels in the toxic range.
8597009		1	Slow acetylators, who comprise roughly 50% of the South African population, are likely to develop clinical and biochemical features of phenytoin toxicity when this drug is given together with antituberculosis therapy.
8597009		1	The wide use of phenytoin during the recent tuberculosis epidemic makes it imperative to suspect this drug interaction in patients exhibiting clinical features that might be related to phenytoin toxicity.
8604715		1	Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular acidosis secondary to foscarnet therapy.
8604715		1	No cases of renal acidosis, and only one case of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, has been previously reported as a complication of foscarnet treatment.
8604715		1	Our patient developed both nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and renal tubular acidosis with a temporal pattern that demonstrated a link between foscarnet therapy and these abnormalities.
8604715		1	We present a patient with human immunodeficiency virus infection under treatment with foscarnet for CMV retinitis who complained of thirst and polyuria.
8610807		1	Choroidal hemorrhage associated with systemic tissue plasminogen activator.
8610807		1	CONCLUSION: The administration of tissue plasminogen activator was responsible for the large extent of hemorrhage and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of hemorrhagic choroidal detachment.
8610807		1	PURPOSE: To determine the cause of spontaneous choroidal hemorrhage in a 67-year-old man after a myocardial infarction and administration of tissue plasminogen activator.
8627446		1	Accelerated nodulosis during methotrexate therapy for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
8627446		1	Although they had only a few nodules at diagnosis, the nodules increased in number and size 3 to 4 months after the start of methotrexate therapy in both patients.
8627446		1	Physicians treating patients with methotrexate for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis must be aware of this extraarticular side effect.
8627446		1	The nodules regressed after withdrawal of methotrexate therapy in one patient and were arrested with the addition of hydroxychloroquine in the other.
8627446		1	We describe two patients with rheumatoid factor-positive, polyarticular-onset juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in whom accelerated nodulosis developed during methotrexate therapy.
8636829		1	A macrophage activation syndrome, possibly related to methotrexate toxicity, developed in a boy with systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
8638872		1	Jaundice induced by streptokinase.
8638872		1	Only a few reports of overt jaundice are associated with streptokinase.
8641617		1	Although both patients recovered from the colitis after the administration of vancomycin, the first case demonstrated a relapse of the colitis after receiving a subsequent course of the same chemotherapy with cisplatin.
8641617		1	Based on our findings, it is thus concluded that cisplatin may cause C. difficile colitis.
8641617		1	Both patients were then treated with a carboplatin alternative to cisplatin in the following courses, which resulted in neither a relapse of the colitis nor a recurrence of the malignancies up to this time.
8641617		1	Clostridium difficile colitis associated with cisplatin-based chemotherapy in ovarian cancer patients.
8641617		1	Severe C. difficile colitis occurred in 2 patients (6.1%) after receiving cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy for ovarian malignancies.

8645078		1	A patient with severe cholestatic jaundice induced by captopril is presented.
8645078		1	"Captopril-associated ""pseudocholangitis'."
8645078		1	Captopril is known to be associated with dermatologic, hematologic, and pulmonary adverse effects.
8645078		1	"Patients treated with captopril who develop ""atypical cholangitis"" should be suspected of having captopril-associated liver damage."
8651254		1	Development of nephrotic syndrome in a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia after treatment with macrophage-colony-stimulating factor.
8651254		1	It should be emphasized that the recurrence of nephrotic syndrome was observed after the following chemotherapy, including M-CSF, whereas the bone marrow still remained completely remitted.
8651254		1	The possibility can be raised that M-CSF accelerated the underlying renal disease in this case through enhancing macrophage accumulation into the glomerulus, leading to the development of nephrotic syndrome.
8651254		1	These evolutional changes in both proteinuria and glomerular histology suggest a close linkage between the M-CSF treatment and macrophage-related glomerular injury.
8651254		1	We describe a patient with acute myeloblastic leukemia (AML) who developed nephrotic syndrome after receiving several courses of chemotherapy, including macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF).
8656412		1	On the fifth day of tocolysis with magnesium sulfate, nifedipine, terbutaline and betamethasone, edema developed in both labia.

8672829		1	Ifosfamide-induced nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
8672829		1	OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient with ifosfamide-induced nonconvulsive status epilepticus.
8672829		1	This represents the first report of nonconvulsive status epilepticus induced by ifosfamide.
8678015		1	Albendazole-induced pseudomembranous colitis.
8678015		1	Although a few case reports link metronidazole with the development of pseudomembranous colitis, albendazole has not been associated with the development of this condition.
8678015		1	While undergoing treatment with albendazole, he developed worsening diarrhea with abdominal pain and fever.
8684546		1	Aluminum intoxication, along with other factors, was considered to be the cause of TC development.
868978		1	Oculomotor disturbances associated with 5-fluorouracil chemotherapy.
868978		1	The ocular motor disturbances are probably an expression of regional 5-FU neurotoxicity primarily affecting the brain stem.
868978		1	Two patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) for disseminated adenocarcinoma of the colon developed cerebellar dysfunction typical of 5-FU neurotoxicity.
8691927		1	Assessment of cortisol response was by insulin-induced hypoglycaemia in three cases, by short tetracosactrin test in two, and by low-dose tetracosactrin and 24-hour urinary cortisol/creatinine ratio in one.
8691927		1	FINDINGS: Six children with growth retardation noted after treatment with high-dose fluticasone propionate were found to have adrenal suppression.
8691927		1	Growth and adrenal suppression in asthmatic children treated with high-dose fluticasone propionate.
8691927		1	INTERPRETATION: When high doses of fluticasone propionate are used, growth may be retarded and adrenal suppression may occur.

8700794		1	A review of the literature found 11 children and 2 adults in whom intranasal desmopressin was associated with hyponatremia, all of whom experienced seizures or altered mental status.
8700794		1	Intranasal desmopressin-induced hyponatremia.
8700794		1	When vague symptoms develop during desmopressin therapy, hyponatremia must be considered as part of the differential diagnosis.
8700794		1	Within 24 hours of fluid restriction and cessation of desmopressin, her symptoms and hyponatremia resolved.
8700794		1	Without other causes for the hyponatremia, she was diagnosed with the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, presumably caused by desmopressin.
8710040		1	Uveitis during treatment of disseminated Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex infection with the combination of rifabutin, clarithromycin and ethambutol.
8726608		1	Does acyclovir increase serum lithium levels?
8726608		1	Six days after starting acyclovir she exhibited signs of lithium toxicity.
8726608		1	This case suggests that acyclovir when given intravenously in doses of 10 mg/kg may result in increased serum lithium concentrations.
8726608		1	Until additional data are available, if intravenous acyclovir is administered concurrently with lithium, we recommend closely monitoring patients for signs of lithium toxicity and measuring serum lithium levels every second or third day.
8726608		1	When measured, the serum lithium level had increased 4-fold during acyclovir therapy.
8730143		1	Dapsone syndrome in cutaneous lupus erythematosus.
8730143		1	Physicians should be aware of the potentially lethal side effects of dapsone.
8730143		1	We describe 2 patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus who developed severe dapsone reaction after low dose therapy, with a fatal outcome in one.
8733532		1	A case is presented which illustrates a probably fatal interaction between minoxidil and a coagulation disorder.
8739289		1	Nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) is a well-documented complication of lithium use.
8739289		1	Potential mechanisms regarding the pathophysiology of lithium-associated CDI are discussed.
8739289		1	The association of central diabetes insipidus (CDI) with lithium use is rare.
8739289		1	This case emphasizes the importance of the evaluation of lithium-associated polyuria with a direct measurement of plasma vasopressin, interpreted with simultaneous plasma and urine osmolality to secure the correct diagnosis and ensure appropriate therapeutic management.
8739289		1	To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of lithium-associated CDI and NDI presenting concurrently.
8739289		1	Transient central diabetes insipidus in the setting of underlying chronic nephrogenic diabetes insipidus associated with lithium use.
8739289		1	We report a patient receiving chronic lithium therapy who presented with a transient CDI occurring in the setting of underlying chronic NDI.
8742573		1	CASE: We report a case of a woman with severe human insulin-induced lipoatrophy who has been treated exclusively with recombinant DNA human insulin since the onset of IDDM.

8749646		1	Improved awareness of and further investigation into the neurotoxic effects of ofloxacin may enhance its safe use.
8749646		1	Seizures associated with ofloxacin therapy.
8749646		1	The renal insufficiency of three patients and the timing of the seizures implicate accumulation of ofloxacin as a contributing factor.
8749646		1	We describe four patients who had seizures while receiving ofloxacin; no other causes were evident.
8763435		1	A patient is described with the characteristic features of phenytoin hypersensitivity syndrome (PHS) including fever, erythroderma, tibial and facial oedema, pinhead-sized facial pustules and abnormal liver function tests.

876914		1	Sarcoma complicating therapy with cyclophosphamide.
8771575		1	A chronic reaction associated with long-term treatment with nitrofurantoin has also been reported and causes irreversible pulmonary fibrosis.
8771575		1	Acute pulmonary reactions to nitrofurantoin are an uncommon side effect of therapy and can cause minor or life-threatening pulmonary dysfunction.
8771575		1	Despite the known pulmonary side effects of nitrofurantoin, there is no report of this toxicity occurring in pregnant patients.
8771575		1	Nitrofurantoin-induced pulmonary toxicity during pregnancy: a report of a case and review of the literature.
8771575		1	We present a case of respiratory failure occurring in a woman at 16 weeks' gestation who was being treated with nitrofurantoin for a urinary tract infection.
8792511		1	Less common adverse events to dapsone include the idiosyncratic reactions of leukopenia and agranulocytosis, cutaneous eruptions, peripheral neuropathy, psychosis, toxic hepatitis, cholestatic jaundice, nephrotic syndrome, renal papillary necrosis, severe hypoalbuminemia without proteinuria, an infectious mononucleosis-like syndrome, and minor neurological and gastrointestinal complaints.
8792511		1	Methemoglobinemia is another common finding among patients receiving dapsone therapy, but rarely does it result in prominent symptoms other than transient pallor.
879939		1	Acetazolamide-accelerated anticonvulsant osteomalacia.
879939		1	Acetazolamide may have accelerated the development of osteomalacia by several mechanisms, including increased renal calcium excretion.
879939		1	Severe osteomalacia was present in two epileptic patients who were under long-term treatment with congeners of phenytoin, phenobarbital, and acetazolamide.
8816294		1	The delayed encephalopathy developed 9 and 22 months respectively after the first dose of intrathecal methotrexate.
8816294		1	We report the case histories of identical twin brothers who developed concordant acute lymphoblastic leukemia at the age of 4 years and who later developed leukoencephalopathy and hydrocephalus related to central nervous system prophylaxis by, in the first case intrathecally administered methotrexate and, in the second by intrathecally administered methotrexate and cranial irradiation.
8825747		1	A retrospective study was conducted of 40 loperamide poisoning cases recorded at the Centre National d'Informations Toxicologiques Veterinaires.

8828999		1	a 67-year-old man with bipolar disorder developed a Creutzfeldt-Jakob like syndrome during lithium carbonate treatment.
8828999		1	Lithium-induced Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome.
8828999		1	Lithium neurotoxicity should be considered in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease differential diagnosis, serial electroencephalograms being the most valuable.
8828999		1	"Several cases of lithium-induced Creutzfeldt-Jakob syndrome have been reported to date; all of them were elderly patients and a half had ""therapeutic"" lithium serum levels."
8832451		1	A noninvasive method in the differential diagnosis of vecuronium-induced and magnesium-induced protracted neuromuscular block in a severely preeclamptic patient.
8832451		1	The occurrence of neuromuscular blockade and the resulting potentiation of muscle relaxants during magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) administration is well known.
8832451		1	We also describe a new, noninvasive method to assess magnesium-induced neuromuscular block when curariform muscle relaxant was given simultaneously.

8844232		1	An unusual case of Ecstasy poisoning.
8844232		1	We describe a case of poisoning with 3,4-methylenedioxymet-amphetamine Ecstasy that presented with all the features suggestive of a fatal outcome, including a creatinine phosphokinase level markedly higher than any previously reported.
8850251		1	However, dermatologists should be cautious about a photosensitivity reaction induced by mequitazine or other phenothiazine-derivative drugs.
8850251		1	In addition, an immediate erythematous macule was observed on the photopatch test site of mequitazine directly after UV exposure which was similar to the immediate erythema noted in chlorpromazine photoallergy.
8850251		1	In case no. 2, the pathogenic mechanism seemed to be persistent light reaction preceded by systemic photoallergy, as he had taken mequitazine for 6 months, and there were strong positive photopatch test results with immediate erythema reaction, cross-reaction to promethazine, decreased MED to both UVA and UVB, and persistence of the photosensitivity over a 3-year follow-up period after discontinuation of the mequitazine.
8850251		1	Mequitazine seemed to play a part similar to chlorpromazine, and absence of mequitazine-induced photosensitivity may be due to a relatively low dosage of the drug.
8850251		1	Two cases of mequitazine-induced photosensitivity reactions.
8850251		1	We experienced 2 cases of mequitazine-induced photosensitivity reaction in patients who took mequitazine for their dermatologic problems.
8862924		1	Keratitis in methamphetamine abusers.
8862924		1	Methamphetamine's extensive physiologic effects, inconsistent street purity, and multiple routes of administration offer many possibilities for injury to the cornea.
8862924		1	"Potential causes of methamphetamine-related keratitis can be divided into four categories resulting from (a) direct pharmacologic and physical effects of methamphetamine; (b) the toxic effects of diluting or ""cutting"" agents such as lidocaine and quinine; (c) effects related to the route of drug administration (intravenous, inhalation, smoking); and (d) manufacture-related effects of exposure to unintentional caustic contaminants in the final product."
8862924		1	The increasing prevalence of methamphetamine abuse and the severity of the associated ulcers should alert ophthalmologists to the problem of methamphetamine-related keratitis.
8862924		1	We report four cases of severe corneal ulceration in methamphetamine abusers.
8864370		1	BACKGROUND: Methotrexate (MTX) may induce liver damage, which in some psoriatics will lead to fibrosis or cirrhosis.
8864370		1	CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed that in most patients MTX-induced liver cirrhosis is not aggressive.
8864370		1	However, continued low-dose MTX led, in spite of normal liver tests, 8 years after the last biopsy to liver failure and death in 1 of our patients.
8864370		1	Methotrexate-induced liver cirrhosis.
8864370		1	Studies performed 10 years ago on 25 patients with MTX-induced liver cirrhosis indicated that this type of cirrhosis was not of an aggressive nature.
8880251		1	After therapy for diabetic coma with insulin (containing the preservative cresol) and electrolyte solutions was started, the patient complained of increasing myalgia, developed a high fever and respiratory and metabolic acidosis and lost consciousness.
8880251		1	However, other factors or drugs (e.g. cresol) are thought to induce MH.
8880251		1	This case supports the assessment that MH and diabetes are associated diseases and that cresol could possibly trigger MH.
889156		1	The use of beclomethasone diproprionate inhaler complicated by the development of an eosinophilic pneumonia reaction.
8891729		1	Fatal intravascular autoimmune hemolytic anemia after fludarabine treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
8891729		1	Physicians should be aware of the risk of severe AIHA in CLL patients with a history of AIHA or positivation of the DAT during previous fludarabine administration, or in case of secondary fixation of complement to the red cell membrane occurring during fludarabine treatment.
8891729		1	The occurrence of severe AIHA in CLL patients treated with fludarabine has been reported by several authors.
8891729		1	We report the case of a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who developed fatal intravascular autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) after fludarabine treatment.
8891729		1	When the patient was treated again with fludarabine nine months later, the DAT became positive with anti-IgG and anti-C3d antiglobulins after the second course of treatment.
8903300		1	She had just finished a 3-week course of intravenous tobramycin for bronchiectasis and had an elevated serum tobramycin trough level 1 week before the onset of tetany.
8903300		1	Tetany in a child with AIDS receiving intravenous tobramycin.
8903300		1	This pattern is suggestive of renal toxicity due to tobramycin.
8908396		1	CONCLUSIONS: In our reported case, a local hyperproduction of TNF-alpha from macrophages that was induced by the injected insulin could explain the dedifferentiation of the adipocytes of the subcutaneous tissue and the reversion that was induced by the local injection of dexamethasone.
8908396		1	Insulin-induced lipoatrophy in type I diabetes.
8908396		1	OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha may mediate the loss and the dedifferentiation of subcutaneous fat tissue in the insulin-induced lipoatrophies of a diabetic patient who presented extensive lesions.
8912599		1	Erosion of psoriatic plaques: an early sign of methotrexate toxicity.
8912599		1	Methotrexate is an effective but potentially toxic treatment for psoriasis.
8912599		1	Painful erosion of psoriatic plaques is a less common sign of methotrexate toxicity that may precede evidence of bone marrow suppression.
8912599		1	We describe two patients in whom painful erosions of their psoriasis developed as the presenting sign of methotrexate toxicity and review the literature, emphasizing the risk factors associated with this manifestation.
8912599		1	Well-known signs of methotrexate toxicity include bone marrow suppression and oral and gastrointestinal ulceration.
8921647		1	After treatment with cimetidine, there was a rapid deterioration with decreased oxygen saturation and arterial PO2 values.
8921647		1	Caution with use of cimetidine in tolazoline induced upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
8921647		1	However, given the clinically significant result to the interaction between tolazoline and cimetidine we report, the use of cimetidine in tolazoline induced upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage should deserve more attention.
8921647		1	Hypoxemia improved during continuous tolazoline infusion, but gastrointestinal bleeding occurred.
8926752		1	Zolpidem (Ambien), a relatively new nonbenzodiazepine sedative-hypnotic, was involved in the death of a 39-year-old obese male who was being treated for depression and insomnia.

9161656		1	Acute asthma associated with sustained-release verapamil.
9161656		1	Although dyspnea associated with verapamil administration has been reported, this is the first report of an elderly asymptomatic asthmatic patient with hypertension who developed an acute asthma attack following sustained-release verapamil administration.
9161656		1	CONCLUSIONS: Sustained-release verapamil is thought to be the cause of the asthma attack in this patient because she was not taking any other preparations; the symptoms started with the administration of sustained-release verapamil and were relieved after its discontinuation.
9161656		1	OBJECTIVE: To describe a patient with asymptomatic bronchial asthma and hypertension who developed an acute asthma attack after receiving sustained-release verapamil.
9161656		1	She continued taking verapamil for 6 months, then, on her own, stopped all medications including the sustained-release verapamil, and her asthma symptoms disappeared.

9177620		1	A possible case of carbamazepine induced pancreatitis.
9177620		1	The authors report a case of acute pancreatitis (AP) occurring in a patient under treatment with carbamazepine (CBZ) for post-traumatic petit mal epilepsy, and review the current literature of drug-induced AP.
9177620		1	The evidence of high plasmatic levels of CBZ and the absence of other aetiologic factors lead the authors to conclude that the overdose of CBZ could have represented the precipitating of the episode of acute pancreatitis.
9184269		1	Although risk factors for MTX-induced pulmonary toxicity are poorly understood, the presence in 3 out of 5 of our patients of pre-existing lung disease, represented by diffuse interstitial changes on chest X-ray, and mild bronchial asthma in two RA patients and by pulmonary silicosis in the patient with PsA may account for a predisposition to the development of MTX pneumonitis.
9184269		1	Methotrexate-induced pneumonitis in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis: report of five cases and review of the literature.
9184269		1	On the other hand, MTX-induced pneumonitis seems to be very rare in psoriatic arthritis (PsA).
9184269		1	Our review of 194 RA patients and 38 PsA patients receiving MTX has identified four RA patients and one PsA patient with MTX-induced pneumonitis, giving a prevalence of 2.1% and 0.03%, respectively.
9184269		1	Pneumonitis is emerging as one of the most unpredictable and potentially serious, adverse effects of treatment with MTX.
9184269		1	The presence of a lymphocyte alveolitis with a predominance of CD4+ T cells in 3 RA patients and CD8+ T cells with a concomitant increase in neutrophils in another case suggests that immunologically mediated reactions may be one damage mechanism in MTX-induced pneumonitis.
91848		1	A retrospective epidemiological study of deaths from hepatic angiosarcoma (HAS) in the U.S. showed that during 1964--74 there were 168 such cases, of which 37 (22%) were associated with previously known causes (vinyl chloride, 'Thorotrast', and inorganic arsenic) and 4 (3.1%) of the remaining 131 cases with the use of androgenic-anabolic steroids.

9220046		1	CASE SUMMARIES: In each case, the patients were treated over 5 years with lovastatin and developed rhabdomyolysis that coincided with the completion of a prescribed regimen of a newer macrolide antibiotic.
9220046		1	CONCLUSIONS: The risk of drug-induced rhabdomyolysis due to the potential interaction between lovastatin and azithromycin or clarithromycin should be considered before the concomitant use of these agents.
9220046		1	DISCUSSION: Rhabdomyolysis is a clinical syndrome resulting from the destruction of skeletal muscle that may progress to renal failure Several drugs have been associated with rhabdomyolysis, including lovastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor.
9220046		1	Erythromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that may increase the risk of lovastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis.
9220046		1	Lovastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis possibly associated with clarithromycin and azithromycin.
9220046		1	OBJECTIVE: To describe two cases of rhabdomyolysis in patients taking lovastatin that were precipitated by the use of the newer macrolide antibiotics clarithromycin and azithromycin.
9220046		1	To our knowledge, these cases are the first published reports of lovastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis associated with azithromycin and clarithromycin.
9224230		1	These cases were considered unusual in light of the short delay of their onset after initiation of immunosuppressive therapy and their fulminant course: 3 of these patients died of PCP occurring during the first month of treatment with prednisone.

9302445		1	Hypercalcemia in an AIDS patient treated with growth hormone.
9302445		1	The hypercalcemia responded to discontinuation of rhGH and a single dose of intravenous pamidronate disodium and has not recurred in 8 months of follow-up.
9302445		1	We report a male patient with advanced AIDS who developed hypercalcemia 2 weeks after institution of rhGH therapy.
9311175		1	Hypersensitivity reactions to cisplatin following multiple uncomplicated courses: a report on two cases.
9311175		1	Two patients with ovarian cancer who had received multiple courses of cisplatin without complications experienced hypersensitivity reactions to cisplatin: one, involving intrahepatic artery infusion, manifested general erythema, dyspnea, and hypotension; the other, involving intravenous infusion, manifested abdominal pain, general erythema, and fever.
9315405		1	We report an unusually short lived and asymptomatic episode of severe cisplatin-induced renal tubular salt wasting in a fit 41-year-old patient with malignant teratoma.
9337441		1	Clinicians should include phenolphthalein in their list of possible causes of drug-induced TEN.
9337441		1	DISCUSSION: Phenolphthalein is the active ingredient in several over-the-counter laxative preparations and has only rarely been reported to cause TEN.
9337441		1	OBJECTIVE: To report a case of phenolphthalein-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) in a patient maintained on several other medications more commonly known to be associated with TEN.
9337441		1	Phenolphthalein-induced toxic epidermal necrolysis.
9337441		1	The patient's previous rash and the temporal relation of this event and the ingestion of phenolphthalein, as well as the similarity of this case to other reports, point to phenolphthalein as the cause of TEN in this patient.
9347384		1	Carbamazepine toxicity induced by clarithromycin coadministration in psychiatric patients.
9347384		1	During clarithromycin coadministration, four out of the seven patients developed moderate-to-severe toxic symptoms of carbamazepine, such as drowsiness, dizziness, and ataxia, which resolved within 5 days after clarithromycin discontinuation.
9347384		1	The present report suggests that clarithromycin coadministration induces increased plasma carbamazepine concentrations, which may result in carbamazepine toxicity.
9352164		1	Acute hemorrhagic gastritis associated with acetazolamide intoxication in a patient with chronic renal failure.
9352164		1	As far as we know, this is the first case report of acute hemorrhagic gastritis associated with AZ intoxication.
9352164		1	She was thus diagnosed as having AZ intoxication.
9352164		1	We experienced a case of chronic renal failure in a patient suffering from acute hemorrhagic gastritis associated with AZ intoxication.
9352164		1	We thus concluded that an excessive dose of AZ had probably destroyed the gastric mucosal barrier or thrombocytopenia due to bone marrow disorder and thus eventually led to the development of hemorrhagic gastritis.
9360190		1	In association with this tocolysis, urinary calculus of magnesium ammonium phosphate occurred at 34 weeks gestation.
9360190		1	Magnesium tocolysis as the cause of urinary calculus during pregnancy.

9362107		1	We diagnosed this case as danazol induced thrombocytopenia.
9366852		1	It occasionally accompanies the heparin-associated thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome.
9366852		1	Skin necrosis is a rare complication of subcutaneous heparin therapy that usually occurs at injection sites.
9366852		1	Skin necrosis secondary to low-molecular weight heparin in a patient with antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.
9366852		1	We describe a patient with the antiphospholipid syndrome who had skin necrosis develop from low-molecular weight heparin therapy at sites distant from injection sites.

9494448		1	BACKGROUND: Hypersensitivity reactions to cyclosporine are rare.
9494448		1	CONCLUSIONS: Hypersensitivity reactions to cyclosporine are due to Cremophor EL.
9494448		1	Fortunately, a hypersensitivity reaction to one formulation of cyclosporine does not preclude use of a different formulation.
9494448		1	METHODS: We report a patient who had an anaphylactic reaction during the intravenous infusion of cyclosporine.
9494448		1	OBJECTIVE: To investigate the mechanisms involved in hypersensitivity reactions to cyclosporine and determine the feasibility of future cyclosporine use.

9701106		1	A drug interaction between zafirlukast and theophylline.
9701106		1	Attempts were made to stop and then restart the theophylline therapy at progressively lower doses; however, with each attempt, the patient's reaction to the drug became more toxic, with serum theophylline levels ranging between 99.9 and 149.9 micromol/L (18 and 27 microg/mL).
9701106		1	One explanation for the noted increase in the theophylline level is that metabolism occurs mainly by cytochrome P450 (CYP 1A2), an enzyme that is known to be inhibited with high concentrations of zafirlukast.
9701106		1	Recently, her serum theophylline levels had increased to the toxic range (133.2 micromol/L [24 microg/mL]) shortly after the addition of zafirlukast (Accolate, Zeneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, Del) to her regimen.

9824032		1	Dental and gingival pain as side effects of niacin therapy.
9824032		1	The cause of these previously unreported side effects of niacin therapy is uncertain but may be related to prostaglandin-mediated vasodilatation, hyperalgesia of sensory nerve receptors, and potentiation of inflammation in the gingiva with referral of pain to the teeth.
9824032		1	Two 65-year-old white men with coronary heart disease, given niacin therapy for dyslipidemia for 5 months, developed intense dental and gingival pain that was associated with increases in dose and that was relieved with discontinuance of niacin treatment.
9831311		1	Although major hazards of treatment of hypophosphatemic osteomalacia with phosphate and calcitriol are secondary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D intoxication, potassium loss also should be kept in mind.
9831311		1	High-dose phosphate treatment leads to hypokalemia in hypophosphatemic osteomalacia.
9831311		1	It was concluded that potassium loss occurred by a non-renal (intestinal) route in phosphate-induced hypokalemia.

9920368		1	Amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis associated with thyrotropin receptor antibody.
9920368		1	Among 12 thyrotoxic patients, a patient with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, who had been taking amiodarone for 4 years, developed thyrotoxicosis with subacute onset, accompanied by transiently positive thyrotropin (TSH) receptor antibody (TRAb), or thyrotropin-binding inhibiting immunoglobulin (TBII).
9920368		1	Since amiodarone was first marketed in 1992 in Japan, the incidence of amiodarone-induced thyrotoxicosis (AIT) has been increasing.
9920368		1	These in vitro findings and clinical course suggest that TRAb/TBII without thyroid-stimulating activity may develop in patients with amiodarone-induced destructive thyroiditis, as reported in patients with destructive thyroiditis, such as subacute and silent thyroiditis.
9925865		1	CONCLUSION: Lipoid pneumonia as a result of mineral oil aspiration still occurs in the pediatric population.

9934637		1	An unusual cause of burn injury: unsupervised use of drugs that contain psoralens.
9934637		1	Because psoralens sensitize skin to ultraviolet A light, phototoxic reactions are the most frequent adverse effect of this treatment.
9934637		1	In this article, we present the case of a vitiligo patient who was admitted to our facility with an intense burn after the topical use of 8-methoxypsoralen solution as a suntanning agent.
9934637		1	Sunburn may sometimes be a major injury in psoralen users because high doses or inappropriate use of the drug may render the skin extremely sensitive.
