10589077,"Of the four patients who responded to HU with an increase in total Hb, all reported symptomatic improvement and three have not required further transfusions.",1
10589077,Prolonged responses were achieved with low doses of HU (3-10 mg/kg/day) and higher doses were associated with mild reversible hematologic or hepatic toxicity and no further increases in Hb.,1
10589077,"Sodium phenylbutyrate was added to treatment with HU in two patients, but failed to produce an increase in total Hb despite increasing Hb F levels.",1
10589077,We conclude that low-dose HU therapy in patients with thalassemia intermedia may increase total Hb levels sufficiently to eliminate the need for transfusions.,1

10592946,Severe rhabdomyolysis following massive ingestion of oolong tea: caffeine intoxication with coexisting hyponatremia.,1
10592946,"The clinical course suggests that caffeine, which is present in oolong tea, was mainly responsible for the rhabdomyolysis as well as the delirium, although severe hyponatremia has been reported to cause rhabdomyolysis on rare occasions.",1
10592946,The possibility of severe rhabdomyolysis should be considered in a patient with water intoxication due to massive ingestion of caffeine-containing beverages.,1
10592946,"We hypothesize that caffeine toxicity injured the muscle cells, which were fragile due to the potassium depletion induced by the coexisting hyponatremia, to result in unusually severe rhabdomyolysis.",1
10599932,"After the addition of citalopram, a desmethylclomipramine plasma level increase and an 8-hydroacy-desmethylclomipramine plasma level decrease were observed.",1

10656221,"In conclusion, this case strongly suggests that gliclazide can induce acute icteric liver necro-inflammation which may be misdiagnosed clinically as acute viral hepatitis.",1
10656221,We believe that this is the first description of acute hepatitis caused by an idiosyncratic adverse reaction to gliclazide or to one of its metabolites.,1
10656221,"We describe the case of acute hepatitis induced by gliclazide, a second generation sulfonylurea.",1

10679548,The spectrum of nitrofurantoin lung injury continues to widen.,1
10679548,The two middle aged women presented with respiratory symptoms after prolonged treatment with nitrofurantoin.,1
10679548,"We suggest that the previous classification of nitrofurantoin induced lung injury into ""acute"" and ""chronic"" injury is an oversimplification in view of the wide variety of pathological entities that have subsequently emerged.",1
